He promoted a message of modernization through his slogan, “Order, Liberty, and Progress”, but the economic benefits of industrialization went almost exclusively toward foreign members of national and regional oligarchies, rich landowners, and foreign capital, while the rural poor suffered.</p>

		<p class="white-bg-text diaz-reason-text" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1000"> Díaz repeatedly violated the principles of the constitution of 1857, courting foreign interests, jailing political opponents, restricting civil liberties, repressing labor movements, and censoring the press. Though he held elections to have a semblance of democracy, in reality the elections only installed candidates who were favorable to himself.</p>

Encouraged by Díaz, Mexico’s wealthy came to own 85% of the land, most of which had been stolen from villagers.</p>

They received no pension or compensation or accidents occurring on the job, and their few civil rights were generally neglected. Most would return home to unsanitary housing and inadequate diets. The average life expectancy in this period was 30 years, while the infant mortality rate was 30%.</p>
