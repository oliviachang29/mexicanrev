In 1919, Colonel Jesus Guajardo, a Carrancista, asked to meet with Zapata in Chinameca on the pretense of switching sides. To gain credibility with Zapata, Guajardo staged a rout against other federal forces, sacrificing whole slews of men in a mock battle.<br><br>On April 10, the day Guajardo and Zapata were to meet, Zapata was ambushed and shot to death by Carrancistas. His last moments were captured in an iconic photograph of him surrounded by his Zapatistas.</p>

		Little star in the night<br>

		who was the scourge of the rich?<br>

		and valleys of Morelos,<br>
		if they ask for Zapata,<br>

		Finally they buried his body<br>
		filled with joy and pleasure<br>
		and many, so many weeped<br>
		for his sins and for his peace.<br>

		But his soul perseveres<br>
		in his ideal of "Liberator"<br>
		and his fearsome skull <br>
		wanders in grief... oh terror!<br>
