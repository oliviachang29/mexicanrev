		<p class="normal-p white-bg white-bg-text huerta-desc-text">Disgruntled with Madero’s presidency, Victoriano Huerta, Felix Díaz (nephew of Porfirio Díaz) and Bernardo Reyes, formed a conspiracy to topple Madero. Under their orders, insurgents stormed Mexico City from February 9-18. At the end of the ten days, Huerta, formerly a general under Díaz but now chief of staff of the army under Madero, betrayed and murdered Madero.</p>

		<p class="normal-p white-bg white-bg-text huerta-desc-text">In response to Huerta’s coup d’etat, Carranza wrote the <i>Plan de Guadalupe</i>, which called for Huerta’s ouster and the restoration of a constitutional government. Carranza used this to establish himself as “First Chief of the Constitutionalist Army”, and put himself as a leader of Anti-Huerta movements.</p>

		<p class="normal-p white-bg white-bg-text huerta-desc-text">Huerta assumed power and dissolved the legislature, prompting heavy opposition from Villa, Carranza, and Zapata. The US distrusted Huerta and sent troops occupying Veracruz in 1914. Zapata, who hated Huerta, executed Huerta’s peace commissioners, and Huerta was thus forced to fight insurrections in both the South (Zapata) and North (Carranza and Villa). Huerta responded by sending Juvencio Robles to burn entire villages in Morelos to the ground.<br><br>When Orozco allied himself with Huerta, Zapata revised the <i>Plan de Ayala</i>, revoking Orozco’s title and making himself the Chief of the Revolution.</p>

During Huerta’s reign, though the Archbishop of Mexico would publish documents which expressed concern as to the legality of Huerta’s presidency, Huerta kept the NCP under control by promising them 100 seats in the legislature.</p>

		<p class="normal-p white-bg white-bg-text huerta-desc-text">When Villa’s troops defeated Huerta’s federal forces in the Second Battle of Juárez, Huerta resigned and was exiled to Europe. With Huerta gone, Carranza called for an assembly of all revolutionary forces. The assembly took place in Aguascalientes, where both the Villa’s delegation and Zapata’s delegation attended. At the convention it became clear that the absence of a common enemy was causing the once unified revolution to splinter. The group which had defeated Díaz and Huerta was composed of people from all corners of Mexican society: businessmen and peons, intellectuals and laborers, each petitioning their different agendas. Zapata’s southern peons, who wanted agrarian reform, clashed with the businessmen who expected efficient agricultural production to continue. Villa’s northern revolutionaries valued political autonomy while the Carrancistas wanted a restoration of the 1857 Constitution.<br><br>By majority vote, the Villistas and the Zapatistas, known as the Conventionists, agreed to appoint General Eulalio Gutiérrez as provisional president, a choice which Carranza and his Carrancistas rejected. Instead, Carranza declared himself president, and Villa and Zapata, as allies, broke from Carranza. His choice brought two years of a bloody civil war to Mexico.
