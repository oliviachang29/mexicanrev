In response, he drafted the <i>Plan de Ayala</i>, a manifesto illuminating his philosophy of agrarian reform. The Plan drew widespread support among peasant groups, prompting many laborers from Southern Mexico to join Zapata’s army. Zapata and his supporters - Zapatistas - used the Plan to determine who they could trust. Anyone who would not agree to the Plan would not receive Zapata’s support. However, most revolutionary leaders were not focused on land reform, making it difficult for Zapata to form alliances.</p>

		<p class="normal-p white-bg">The Plan accused Madero of failing to carry out the promises he had made during the revolution. It said Madero had preserved key elements of Díaz’s corrupt regime, and Madero, like Díaz, had no respect for the Constitution of 1857. The Plan declared the new focus of the revolution to overthrow the  “dictatorial elements of Porfirio Díaz and Francisco I. Madero”. Anyone who fought for the revolution were to help overthrow Madero, or be considered enemies.</p>

Large plantations, owned by single family, would have one third of their land nationalized, to be given to poor farmers. Those who resisted would have the rest expropriated.</p>
